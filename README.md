# Bookwork-Burrow
Bookworm Burrow is an ebook library application made for students, professors and anyone who doesn't want to carry a lot of books around and likes the portability and comfort of reading anywhere.

Unlike other ebook readers, we offer discounts to students and professors, and we offer free temporary access to random books each week for everyone to enjoy, promoting the authors and their work, as well as promoting literacy and learning.
